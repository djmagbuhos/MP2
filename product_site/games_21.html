            Saga Anderson is a gifted FBI agent called to the small Pacific
            Northwest town of Bright Falls to investigate a series of
            ritualistic murders. Alan Wake is a writer who has spent years
            trapped in the Dark Place, a terrifying alternate reality that can
            be reshaped by his words. Although they have never met, the two are
            connected across separate realities, their actions able to change
            their respective worlds. When the events depicted in a horror story
            cause Bright Falls to become engulfed in a corrupting, supernatural
            darkness, both Anderson and Wake must use the power of light to
            survive and to protect the ones they love. In a reality-bending
            world of victims and monsters, can they become the heroes of this
            story?
